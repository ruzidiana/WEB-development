        <p>I was lucky enough to live close to nature when I was young.
What did I learn?
I learned to be curious, to discover the world of animals, insects, flowers, plants and trees.
I also learned to be alone, enjoy myself and feel at home even far from my parents.
The best part?
I kept that curiosity today and I still love to spend time in nature every week.

It’s crucial for my physical and mental health.
In sum,nature, hiking and trail running are part of the reason I know myself a lot more today.I couldn’t be more grateful.</p>
